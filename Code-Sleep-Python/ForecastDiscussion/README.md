# Forecast Discussion using NWS API

It's easy to stick your head out the window and see what the weather is or to look at a website and see what the weather will be tomorrow.  But do you wonder why that website says what the weather will be tomorrow?  

Usually twice daily, there is an area forecast discussion put out by the National Weather Service explaining why they've made the decisions they have regarding the forecast they put out.  This script will retrieve that discussion for Minneapolis (MPX) and post it in your CLI.
