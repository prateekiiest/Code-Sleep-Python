# Space shooter
I am really fond of playing around with the pygame module at times. Check out this minimalistic space shooter game made solely using pygame

## Dependencies:
* Pygame - ***pip install pygame*** does everything to get this installed.

## Usage:
1. Simply execute the command: ***python main.py*** to launch your game. 
2. Use the classic keys: **W,A,S,D** as movement keys and hit **Space bar** to shoot.

Note: My Linux Display Drivers have some issues so the GUI may not look as pleasing it actually is. Try it out yourself :smile:
