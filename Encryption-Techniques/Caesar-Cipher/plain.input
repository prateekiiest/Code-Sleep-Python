In the early days, building computer systems was easy. Why, you ask?
Because users didn't expect much. It is those darned users with their
expectations of "ease of use", "high performance", "reliability", etc., that
really have led to all these headaches. Next time you meet one of those
computer users, thank them for all the problems they have caused. Hi.
