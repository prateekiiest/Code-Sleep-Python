Hi, this is a Telegram chatbot, which was made for the sake of learning.

We use the Telegram Rest API.

entire logic is in my.py

To learn about building chatbots refer this link for tutorial : https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-telegram-bot-using-python-part-1-goi5fncay

Do refer this link on how to generate your ID, and how to run this bot.
I am very lazy to add descriptions and documentation.
